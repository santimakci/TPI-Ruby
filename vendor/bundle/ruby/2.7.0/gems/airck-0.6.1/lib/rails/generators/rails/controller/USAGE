Description:
    Stubs out a new controller and its displays. Pass the controller name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of displays as arguments.

    To create a controller within a module, specify the controller name as a
    path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a controller class in app/servants and invokes helper,
    template engine and test framework generators.

Example:
    `rails generate controller CreditCard open debit credit close`

    Credit card controller with URLs like /credit_card/debit.
        Controller:      app/servants/credit_card_controller.rb
        Functional Test: test/functional/credit_card_controller_test.rb
        Displays:        app/displays/credit_card/debit.html.erb [...]
        Helper:          app/helpers/credit_card_helper.rb
